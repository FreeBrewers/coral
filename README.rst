Coral red Ale
=============

The Coral red Ale is an Irish Red made by Wilian, Ramiro, Rafael, Osvaldo and Luiz Capitulino, we use snake names because we like the python programming language. Coral is a very poisonous small snake, its predominat color is red, so it is the reason we decided to name this beer coral.

The repository holds this README file, the recipe and the label graphics.
